I think that many of you have met such a problem: you are working with the text editor, then save the document and close the editor. At the next day you are rereading the text and understand that one of the previous versions was better but there is no way to return it. This problem could be solved with the version control system (for example, git), but it is used by developers, mostly, not by common people who work with texts. In this mission you will help to this people by creating a prototype of the text editor with the version control system, which will allow to save different versions of the text and restore any of them.<br>
You task is to create 2 classes: Text and SavedText. The first will works with the texts (adding, font changing etc.), the second will control the versions and save them.<br><br>
Class Text should have the next methods:<br>
<strong>write</strong>(text) - adds (text) to the current text.<br>
<strong>set_font</strong>(font name) - sets chosen font. Font is applied to the whole text even if it was added after the font was set. The font displayed in the square brackets before the text and after: "[Arial]...example...[Arial]". Font could be set multiple times but only the last variant is displays.<br>
<strong>show()</strong> - returns the current text and font (if is was set).<br>
<strong>restore</strong>(SavedText.get_version(number)) - restore the text of the chosen version.<br>
<br>
Class SavedText should have the next methods:<br>
<strong>save_text</strong>(Text) - save the current text and font. The first saved version has the number 0, the second - 1 and so on.<br>
<strong>get_version</strong>(number) - this method is work with the method 'restore' and used for choosing the righ–µ version of the text.<br>
<br>
In this mission you could use the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern'>Memento</a> design pattern.

<p>
<strong>Example</strong>:
<pre class="brush: python">
text = Text()
saver = SavedText()
    
text.write("At the very beginning ")
saver.save_text(text)
text.set_font("Arial")
saver.save_text(text)
text.write("there was nothing.")
text.show() == "[Arial]At the very beginning there was nothing.[Arial]"
    
text.restore(saver.get_version(0))
text.show() == "At the very beginning "
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>information about text and saves.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong>text after all commands.
</p>


<p class="for_info_only">
    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    For the save of the object previous states with possibility to return to them if something go wrong.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    No more than 10 saves.
</p>
